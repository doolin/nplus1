# Serna's Fix N + 1

BH Serna's "Fix n+1 queries on Rails" is a short, reasonably
in-depth look at the n+1 problem commonly arising through
indiscriminate use of ORMs such as Active Record. The nice
thing about Serna's treatment is that it's well-suited for
example implementation, as shown in this repo.

It's a well-understood problem, which all engineers using Rails
(or Active Record) engineering should be well acquainted with.
